Model: Chat GPT 5

- Understand how to use **bcftools**, **IGV**, and **VCF/BAM file interpretation**.
- Fix command errors (non-zero exit codes from `subprocess.run` and missing input paths).
- Rewrite the `get_phased_calls()` function to correctly parse genotypes using `bcftools view -H`.
- Implement helper functions for counting variants per haplotype and summarizing diplotypes.

AI explanations helped clarify how the **phased genotypes (0|1, 1|0)** indicate which allele carries the variant, how to interpret discordant results in **IGV**, and how to check for non-common variants using coordinates from the PharmVar star-allele database.

> “How do I know which variants are common vs. non-common when selecting for analysis?”
> “What does ‘0|1’ vs ‘1|0’ mean in the GT field of a VCF file?”  
> “How do I tell if a missing variant is due to alignment issues or the reference build mismatch?”
