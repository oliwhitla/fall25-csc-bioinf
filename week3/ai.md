AI Model: ChatGPT 5

1) I ported the original code to plain Python (CPython)

```
You are an expert in Codon / typed-Python AOT compilation. Port the following CPython module to typed Python (TPython/Codon). Keep behavior identical but enforce Codon’s rules:

All collections must be homogeneous; annotate as needed (e.g., List[int], Dict[str, float]).

Classes must declare fields explicitly (dataclass-style).

Ensure float/int operations are type-consistent

Replace frozenset keys for undirected pairs with a normalized tuple key: (min(i, j), max(i, j)). Update all dict/set uses accordingly (e.g., Dict[Tuple[int,int], float]).

etc, above are examples, the original prompt changed overtime
```
I did have problem which is it kept auto-adding Optional[...] to my types. 

2) Porting from python to codon

I ran into architecture and Python-ABI mismatches when trying to use Codon’s Python bridge (from python import numpy as np + import numpy.pybridge). Codon needs to load the exact Python shared library that NumPy was built against. On mixed setups (Intel vs ARM64, system Python vs Conda, Rosetta, etc.), the bridge kept finding the wrong lib, which made imports fragile or fail outright.

Root cause (technical):

Architecture mismatch: e.g., x86_64 vs arm64 wheels or running under Rosetta.

ABI mismatch: The Python shared lib Codon loads (via CODON_PYTHON) must match the interpreter that built/installed NumPy. If Codon picks a different Python (or a different env), the C extension (NumPy) won’t load.

Env drift: Switching between system Python, Conda, and virtualenvs changes which libpython and NumPy Codon “sees.”

I used ChatGPT extensively to troubleshoot the Codon/NumPy bridge (Intel vs ARM64, CODON_PYTHON, and import behavior). I don’t have all the intermediate prompts because it was iterative and frustrating over multiple sessions.

When I was finally able to start porting I followed the assignment’s suggested prompts (e.g., “Port UPGMA to Codon with homogeneous lists,” “Use Codon’s numpy import style”) as the starting point for my implementation. I applied them to my files (upgma_codon.py, tree_codon.py) and adjusted type annotations and array handling to satisfy Codon’s ahead-of-time type checking.
